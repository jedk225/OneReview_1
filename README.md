## MVP
We are building a web app that utilized the Walmart and YouTube APIs to provide shoppers with a seamless product research experience.

We are targeting any and all potential buyers 

The problem is that people have to look at many different web pages to information regarding the product they are interested in purchasing.

Our goal is to create a web app that will display all of the necessary information a potential buyer would need to make an educated decision on a product they are looking to purchase

### Description
Our project simplifies the online shopping experience by giving users essential information regarding their product search and also provides an additional review video source from YouTube

### Motivation
The modern shopper loves to gather as much information as they can about their products so they can make an informed decisions before purchasing

### Results
The end result is a web app that revolutionalizes the user shopping experience

### Team Efforts
Jed - Developed the index page that displays user search results on the page utilizing the Walmart and YouTube APIs
Lilo - Developed the testimonials page with data retention utilizing the Firebase database
Jasmine - Developed the front-end CSS, working with the UI-Kit library
Ray - Developed the html page for the user testimonials page. Working on future updates.


### Improvements
In the future, we would like to make calls to other retail APIs such as Best Buy or Target in order to give the users more options to look through. We can add a feature that will display the best price between all the retailers.
