Web app that simplifies the online shopping experience by giving users essential information regarding their product search and also provides an additional review video source from YouTube

## MVP
We are building a web app that utilized the Walmart and YouTube APIs to provide shoppers with a seamless product research experience.

We are targeting any and all potential buyers 

The problem is that people have to look at many different web pages to information regarding the product they are interested in purchasing.

Our goal is to create a web app that will display all of the necessary information a potential buyer would need to make an educated decision on a product they are looking to purchase
